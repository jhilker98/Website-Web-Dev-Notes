# Front End Web Development Notes

> A collection of personal notes for learning web development.

This is a living document as I continue to add notes through my programming journey.

# Reason

What began as wanting (read needing) to organize my notes so future me could retrieve them quickly and easily turned into a desire to share my knowledge with others.

# Structure

The raw markdown files are within the `/src/pages/` directory. Organized by topic.
