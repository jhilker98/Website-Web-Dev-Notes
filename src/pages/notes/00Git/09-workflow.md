# Feature Branch Workflow

**Local Feature Branch**

- `git branch` list of all branches and current branch

- `git checkout -b somefeature` makes new local feature branch

- `git checkout somefeature` switches to feature branch

- `git add .` stages changes

- `git commit -am 'msg'` commits changes

- `git push -u origin somefeature` makes branch at remote

- `git push` pushes local feature commits to remote feature branch

**Local Main Branch**

- `git checkout main` switches to main branch

- `git merge somefeature origin` merges commits from remote feature branch onto main branch

- `git push` pushes local main branch commits to remote main branch

If you need to have newest changes from main branch in addition to feature branch changes.

- `git checkout somefeature` switches to feature branch

- `git pull origin main` pulls remote main branch changes into local feature branch

- `git push` pushes local feature commits to remote feature branch

**Delete Feature Branch**

After branch has been committed and merged it can be deleted. History is preserved.

- `git branch -d somefeature` deletes local feature branch

- `git push origin --delete somefeature` deletes feature branch from remote

# Tags

**Display**

`git tag` displays all tags

`git tag -l -n1` displays one line of msg for each tag

**Add*

`git tag -a v0.1.0 -m 'initial release' someHash` adds tag to given commit

`git push origin v0.1.0` pushes tag to remote

`git push origin --tags` pushes all tags to remote

# Local Python Server

Navigate to project root directory

`py -m http.server 8000` runs server at localhost:8000

`CTRL-c` stops server

# SSH Keys

`ls -al ~/.ssh` view existing keys

`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C githubemail` make new keys

`eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` turn on agent

`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` add new keys

# Forked Remote

`git remote -v` shows current linked repositories

`git remote add upstream httpsaddressofrepositorytofork` add original repository as upstream , this is the original repository , not the fork of the original repository

`git remote -v` confirm upstream added

`git fetch upstream` gets newest changes from upstream

`git merge upstream/main` merges upstream to local main

`git push` pushes updated changes to your repository fork
